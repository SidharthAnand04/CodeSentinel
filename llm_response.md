### Code Review Report

#### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**File Name:** demo.c

**Syntax Issues:** 
- Line 7: Off-by-one error in the loop condition (`i <= size` should be `i < size`) [[1]].

**Styling Issues:** 
- Proper indentation and formatting are maintained.

**Errors and Potential Issues:** 
- Logic error in the loop condition.
- Potential issue with using freed memory in `printArray` after `free(arr)`.

**Recommendations:** 
- Correct the loop condition to `i < size`.
- Avoid accessing memory after it has been freed.
