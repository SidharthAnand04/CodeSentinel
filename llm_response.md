### Commit: `6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d`
**Author:** SidharthAnand04 <sanand12@illinois.edu>  
**Date:** 2024-07-22 15:31:55-07:00  
**Message:** Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/SidharthAnand04/CodeSentinel  

**Changed File:** `demo.c`  
**Changed Lines:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= size; i++) { // Off-by-one error
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 10;
    
    arr = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    printArray(arr, size);

    free(arr);
    arr = NULL; // Setting arr to NULL after free, good practice but often forgotten

    printf("Array values after free:\n");
    printArray(arr, size); // Using freed memory

    return 0;
}
```

### Syntax Issues:
- **Line 6:** The loop condition in `printArray` should be `i < size`, not `i <= size` to prevent accessing an out-of-bounds index.

### Styling Issues:
- The code is generally well-formatted. However, adding a header comment for the `printArray` function to describe its purpose would enhance readability.

### Errors and Potential Issues:
- **Line 23:** Invoking `printArray(arr, size)` after `free(arr)` results in undefined behavior, since `arr` becomes a dangling pointer. This is a critical issue that must be addressed immediately.
- **Memory Leak Potential:** Though a check for `malloc` failure is included, always ensure to handle memory exceptions gracefully.

### Recommendations:
- Change the loop condition in `printArray` from `i <= size` to `i < size`.
- Eliminate the code line that tries to print `arr` after freeing it, as this leads to invalid memory access. Consider adding a condition to check if the pointer is valid before trying to access it.

### Commit: `04b6e1bed000acb86a009ede4f0362980fcb2755`
**Changed File:** `codetest.c`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* arr;
    // random comment
    // another random comment
    int n = 10;
    arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Intentionally causing a buffer overflow
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i; // Off-by-one error
    }
    
    // Missing NULL check for malloc
    char* buffer = malloc(256);
    strcpy(buffer, "This is a test string.");

    // Potential memory leak
    if (buffer != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", buffer);
    }

    // Unused variable
    int unused = 5;

    // Forgot to free allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

### Syntax Issues:
- There are no syntax errors.

### Styling Issues:
- Comments should provide clarity and context. Avoid vague comments like `// random comment`.
- The unused variable `unused` should be removed to maintain code clarity.

### Errors and Potential Issues:
- **Line 10:** The loop condition `i <= n` must be changed to `i < n` to prevent buffer overflow by accessing `arr[n]`.
- **Line 20:** Lack of a check for `malloc` failure before using `buffer` can lead to dereferencing a `NULL` pointer.
- **Memory Leak Potential:** The allocated memory for `buffer` should be freed before exiting the function to avoid leaks.

### Recommendations:
- Change the loop condition from `i <= n` to `i < n`.
