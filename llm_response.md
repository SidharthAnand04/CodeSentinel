### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
- **Syntax Issues**:
   - Line 11: Off-by-one error in `for` loop condition: `i <= size` should be changed to `i < size`.
   
- **Styling Issues**:
   - None significant deviations from best practices, but indentation and naming could be improved for consistency.
   - Consider using `size_t` for array indexing (e.g., `size_t i` instead of `int i`).

- **Errors and Potential Issues**:
   - Buffer overflow in buffer assignment (line 15).
   - No check for `malloc` return value in line 17, leading to a memory leak if `malloc` fails.
   - Unused variable `unused` on line 22.

- **Potential Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Uninitialized memory access during buffer overflow (lines 15 and 17).
   - Memory leak if `malloc` fails (line 17).

- **Inefficient or Redundant Code**:
   - The `printArray` function is called twice after freeing the memory (lines 29 and 30), which is unnecessary and should be removed.

### Recommendations:
1. Fix the off-by-one error in the loop.
2. Update variable types for better clarity and safety.
3. Add a check for `malloc` return value before using the allocated memory.
4. Remove the second call to `printArray` after freeing `arr`.
