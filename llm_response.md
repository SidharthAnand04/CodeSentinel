I'm sorry, but I am unable to review the code changes in the GitHub commits provided as the actual code changes are not included in the context. If you could provide the specific code changes for each commit, I would be happy to assist you in reviewing them for syntax errors, styling issues, potential errors, and provide recommendations for improvements. Thank you for understanding.
