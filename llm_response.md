#### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**File Name:** demo.c

**Syntax Issues:** No syntax errors found.

**Styling Issues:** The loop condition in the `printArray` function has an off-by-one error. Additionally, a comment about setting `arr` to `NULL` after `free` should be included in the code.

**Errors and Potential Issues:** There is a logic error in the `printArray` function loop condition, a runtime error due to using freed memory, and a potential issue with setting `arr` to `NULL` after `free`.

**Recommendations:** Update the `printArray` function loop condition to `i < size`, add a comment about setting `arr` to `NULL` after `free`.
