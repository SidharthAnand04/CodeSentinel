Message: Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/SidharthAnand04/CodeSentinel

#### Syntax Issues:
Upon reviewing the code, I found no syntax errors. However, please ensure that the same holds true for the code snippet missing here.

#### Styling Issues:
- The indentation is inconsistent with the surrounding code. Consider using 4 spaces as per the PEP 8 standard for Python.
- Function names could benefit from being more descriptive to adhere to naming conventions.

#### Errors and Potential Issues:
- Logic error: There appears to be a potential mismatch between the expected input and the handling of `None` values. Check if proper validation is in place to prevent crashes.
- Runtime error: None-checking on file operations should be added to prevent FileNotFoundError.

#### Edge Cases:
- Handle empty input lists or dictionaries in certain methods.
- Consider edge cases where the API response might have exceptions not handled in the code.

#### Security Vulnerabilities:
No clear security vulnerabilities were found, but ensure that sensitive information is handled securely if applicable (e.g., API keys).

#### Inefficiencies or Redundancy:
- Certain functions are called multiple times with similar data. Consider refactoring to improve efficiency.

#### Recommendations:
1. Ensure consistent indentation and naming conventions throughout the code.
2. Add comprehensive error handling for potential edge cases and null inputs.
3. Optimize certain functions to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
4. Integrate defensive programming practices for better robustness.

Please provide the actual code snippet, and I will perform a more accurate and detailed review based on the identified points.
