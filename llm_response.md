### Code Review Report

#### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**Author:** SidharthAnand04 <sanand12@illinois.edu>  
**Date:** 2024-07-22 15:31:55-07:00  
**Message:** Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/SidharthAnand04/CodeSentinel  

#### Changed Files:
- **File:** demo.c  

**Original Code:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= size; i++) { // Off-by-one error
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 10;
    
    arr = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    printArray(arr, size);

    free(arr);
    arr = NULL; // Setting arr to NULL after free, good practice but often forgotten

    printf("Array values after free:\n");
    printArray(arr, size); // Using freed memory

    return 0;
}
```

#### Syntax Issues:
- No syntax errors detected.

#### Styling Issues:
- Consistent indentation throughout the code is observed.
- Naming conventions are followed.
- It is recommended to remove comments that state the obvious, such as `// Off-by-one error`.

#### Errors and Potential Issues:
1. **Logic Errors:**
   - **Line 7:** The loop should use `i < size` instead of `i <= size` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.
   - **Line 24:** Calling `printArray(arr, size)` after freeing `arr` in line 22 causes undefined behavior.

2. **Runtime Errors:**
   - The program does not handle possible errors from `printf` and does not check if `malloc` returns NULL before accessing the pointer.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - If `size` is 0 or negative, `printArray` would cause undefined behavior.

4. **Potential Security Vulnerabilities:**
   - User inputs must be validated to prevent buffer overflow or memory corruption. No user inputs are shown here, but consideration for future modifications is key.

5. **Inefficient or Redundant Code:**
   - After `free(arr);`, setting `arr = NULL;` is good practice, but accessing it afterward misleads code readers.

#### Recommendations:
- Fix the loop in `printArray`: replace `i <= size` with `i < size`.
- Remove the attempt to print freed `arr`.
- Consider adding checks at the beginning of `printArray` to return immediately if `size` is less than or equal to zero.
- Implement better error handling for memory allocation and program execution.
