#### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**File Name:** demo.c

**Syntax Issues:** 
- Line 7: Off-by-one error in the for loop condition. It should be `i < size` instead of `i <= size`.

**Styling Issues:** 
- Proper indentation and formatting are maintained.

**Errors and Potential Issues:** 
- Logic error in the for loop condition.
- Using freed memory in `printArray` after `free(arr)`.

**Recommendations:** 
- Correct the off-by-one error in the for loop condition.
- Avoid using freed memory in `printArray`.
