Based on the provided code changes in the GitHub commits, here is the detailed code review report:

### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**File:** demo.c

#### Syntax Issues:
- No syntax errors detected.

#### Styling Issues:
- Consistent indentation and naming conventions are observed.
- Consider removing comments that state the obvious, such as `// Off-by-one error`.

#### Errors and Potential Issues:
1. **Logic Errors:**
   - **Line 7:** Change `i <= size` to `i < size` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.
   - **Line 24:** Calling `printArray(arr, size)` after freeing `arr` causes undefined behavior.
2. **Runtime Errors:**
   - No error handling for `printf` and missing NULL check for `malloc`.
3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - Undefined behavior if `size` is 0 or negative.
4. **Potential Security Vulnerabilities:**
   - Validate user inputs to prevent buffer overflow or memory corruption.
5. **Inefficient or Redundant Code:**
   - Accessing `arr` after freeing it can mislead code readers.

#### Recommendations:
- Fix the loop in `printArray` by changing `i <= size` to `i < size`.
- Remove the attempt to print freed `arr`.
- Add checks in `printArray` to handle cases where `size` is less than or equal to zero.
- Implement better error handling for memory allocation and program execution.
