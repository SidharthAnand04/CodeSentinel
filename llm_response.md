### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**Author:** SidharthAnand04 <sanand12@illinois.edu>  
**Date:** 2024-07-22 15:31:55-07:00  
**Message:** Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/SidharthAnand04/CodeSentinel

**File Name:** demo.c  

**Original Code:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= size; i++) { // Off-by-one error
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 10;
    
    arr = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    printArray(arr, size);

    free(arr);
    arr = NULL; // Setting arr to NULL after free, good practice but often forgotten

    printf("Array values after free:\n");
    printArray(arr, size); // Using freed memory

    return 0;
}
```

#### Syntax Issues:
- **Line 7:** The loop condition `i <= size` is incorrect, it should be `i < size` to avoid an off-by-one error. [[1]]

#### Styling Issues:
- The code is generally well-formatted and maintains proper indentation.

#### Errors and Potential Issues:
- **Logic Error (Line 7):** The loop condition should be changed to `i < size` to prevent accessing out-of-bounds memory. [[1]]
- **Using Freed Memory (Line 19):** The code attempts to print the values of `arr` after it has been freed, which leads to undefined behavior. [[2]]

#### Recommendations:
- Change the loop condition in the `printArray` function to `i < size`.
- Remove calls to `printArray(arr, size)` after the memory has been freed.

**Date:** 2024-07-22 14:36:53-07:00  
**Message:** asdafsdqert 

**File Name:** codetest.c  
**Original Code:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* arr;
    // random comment
    // another random comment
    int n = 10;
    arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Intentionally causing a buffer overflow
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }

    // Missing NULL check for malloc
    char* buffer = malloc(256);
    strcpy(buffer, "This is a test string.");

    // Potential memory leak
    if (buffer != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", buffer);
    }

    // Unused variable
    int unused = 5;

    // Forgot to free allocated memory
    // additional comment
    return 0;
}
```

#### Syntax Issues:
- **Line 11:** Missing `#include <string.h>` for `strcpy`. [[3]]

#### Styling Issues:
- Comments are clear, though removing unnecessary comments could improve clarity.

#### Errors and Potential Issues:
- **Buffer Overflow (Line 11):** The loop condition `i <= n` should be `i < n` to prevent writing beyond allocated memory. [[4]]
- **Missing NULL Check for malloc (Line 15):** There should be a NULL check after `malloc` to handle memory allocation failure. [[5]]
- **Unused Variable (Line 26):** The variable `unused` is declared but never used. [[6]]
- **Memory Leak (Lines 15-17):** Memory allocated with `malloc` for `buffer` is not freed. [[7]]

#### Recommendations:
- Correct the loop condition to `i < n`.
- Add a NULL check after allocating `buffer`.
- Free allocated memory for `buffer` at the end of the program to prevent memory leaks.
- Remove or utilize the `unused` variable to enhance code cleanliness.
