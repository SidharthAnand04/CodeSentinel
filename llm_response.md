**Code Review Report**

**Commit:** 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d

**Syntax Issues:**

* In the `printArray` function, the loop condition should be `i < size` instead of `i <= size` to avoid an off-by-one error.

**Styling Issues:**

* The code is generally well-formatted, but there are some inconsistencies in indentation and spacing.
* The `printArray` function could be improved by using a more descriptive name, such as `printIntArray`.

**Errors and Potential Issues:**

* In the `main` function, the `printArray` function is called with an uninitialized `arr` pointer, which can cause a segmentation fault.
* The `free` function is called on a pointer that is not necessarily initialized, which can lead to memory leaks.
* The `printArray` function is called after the `arr` pointer is set to `NULL`, which can cause a segmentation fault.
* The `printArray` function is not checked for errors, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Recommendations:**

* Initialize the `arr` pointer before calling the `printArray` function.
* Check the return value of the `malloc` function to ensure that it is not `NULL`.
* Use a more descriptive name for the `printArray` function.
* Add error handling for the `printArray` function.
* Consider using a more robust memory management library, such as `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`, to avoid memory leaks.
