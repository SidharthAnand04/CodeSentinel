#### Commit: **6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d**
- **Author**: SidharthAnand04 <sanand12@illinois.edu>
- **Date**: 2024-07-22 15:31:55-07:00
- **Message**: Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/SidharthAnand04/CodeSentinel

**File: `demo.c`**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= size; i++) { // Off-by-one error
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int *arr;
    int size = 10;
    
    arr = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    printArray(arr, size);

    free(arr);
    arr = NULL; // Setting arr to NULL after free, good practice but often forgotten

    printf("Array values after free:\n");
    printArray(arr, size); // Using freed memory

    return 0;
}
```

### Syntax Issues:
- **Line 8**: The loop condition in the `printArray` function should utilize `i < size` instead of `i <= size`. Using `i <= size` can lead to accessing memory out of bounds (undefined behavior).

### Styling Issues:
- The overall formatting is acceptable. Consider separating comments with spaces for readability.
- **Line 5**: It's recommended to explicitly state the type in the function name, e.g., `printIntArray`.

### Errors and Potential Issues:
- **Line 8**: The condition `i <= size` allows out-of-bounds access.
- **Line 19**: There is an attempt to print `arr` after it has been freed, which leads to undefined behavior. Accessing freed memory is a serious issue.
- Memory allocations (malloc) should always have checks immediately after allocation to avoid segmentation faults.

### Recommendations:
- **Line 8**: Change the loop condition to `i < size`.
- Avoid accessing `arr` after it's been freed.
- Introduce memory allocation checks immediately after calling `malloc` on relevant pointers.

- **Author**: SidharthAnand04 <sanand12@illinois.edu>

- **Message**: update 2

**File: `codetest.c`**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* arr;
    // random comment
    // another random comment
    int n = 10;
    arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Intentionally causing a buffer overflow
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }

    // Missing NULL check for malloc
    char* buffer = malloc(256);
    strcpy(buffer, "This is a test string.");

    // Potential memory leak
    if (buffer != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", buffer);
    }

    // Unused variable
    int unused = 5;

    // Forgot to free allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

### Syntax Issues:
- None.

### Styling Issues:
- Comments are generic; more meaningful comments are encouraged.
  
### Errors and Potential Issues:
- **Line 10**: The loop condition `i <= n` can result in a buffer overflow since `arr[n]` is out of bounds.
- **Line 15**: The `strcpy` function can lead to undefined behavior if `buffer` is `NULL`.
- Potential memory leak: if `buffer` is allocated but never freed.
- The variable `unused` is declared but never used.

### Recommendations:
- Correct the loop condition to `i < n`.
- Introduce checks for both `arr` and `buffer` immediately after malloc calls.
- Ensure all allocated memory is freed before program termination to avoid memory leaks.
- Remove or utilize the `unused` variable appropriately.

### Summary of Reviews:
The code highlights various potential pitfalls related to memory management in C, especially regarding boundary checks and proper memory handling practices. Thoughtfully addressing these aspects will greatly enhance the robustness and stability of the application. Adhere to the recommendations presented to mitigate identified issues and improve code quality.
