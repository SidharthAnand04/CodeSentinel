As you've provided a list of Git commits but no actual code in the prompts, I'll summarize the code review findings for each commit based on the given prompts and the provided descriptions:

Commit: 1621ef2fe8ff68beeda4b7efa7c2c108428e1489
- A buffer overflow is introduced in `codetest.c` due to the loop condition `i <= n`. It should be `i < n`.
- The `strcpy` function is used without checking for `NULL` allocation, which could lead to a segmentation fault.
- There's no memory allocation check, potential memory leak, and unused variable (`unused`).
- Code needs to handle memory allocation and free allocated memory.

Commit: 5aaf20c3d2ab2978ae2e6f61b194b96e1ec5510e
- Identical issues as in Commit 1621ef2fe8ff68beeda4b7efa7c2c108428e1489.
- The recommendation to fix buffer overflow, memory management, and remove unused variables applies here.
