# CodeSentinel

Welcome to **CodeSentinel**, a demo repository created for testing purposes. CodeSentinel is designed to track changes in a repository, feed them into a Language Learning Model (LLM), generate a bug log, and commit this log back to the repository.

## Features

- **Automated Change Tracking**: Monitors changes in the repository.
- **LLM Integration**: Feeds changes into a Language Learning Model for analysis.
- **Bug Log Generation**: Automatically generates a bug log based on the analysis.
- **Commit Automation**: Commits the generated bug log back to the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
- **Git**: Git should be installed and configured on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SidharthAnand04/CodeSentinel.git
    cd CodeSentinel
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Make changes to your repository as needed.

2. Run the CodeSentinel script to track changes and generate a bug log:
    ```sh
    python codesentinel.py
    ```

3. The script will automatically commit the generated bug log to the repository.

**Commit: 04b6e1bed000acb86a009ede4f0362980fcb2755**  
**Author:** SidharthAnand04  
**Date:** 2024-07-22 14:36:53-07:00  
**Message:** asdafsdqert  
**Changed File:** codetest.c  
**Contents:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* arr;
    // random comment
    // another random comment
    int n = 10;
    arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Intentionally causing a buffer overflow
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }

    // Missing NULL check for malloc
    char* buffer = malloc(256);
    strcpy(buffer, "This is a test string.");

    // Potential memory leak
    if (buffer != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", buffer);
    }

    // Unused variable
    int unused = 5;

    // Forgot to free allocated memory
    // additional comment
    return 0;
}
```

#### Syntax Issues:
- No syntax issues found.

#### Styling Issues:
- The code lacks proper indentation, making it difficult to read and understand.

#### Errors and Potential Issues:
- Logic error: The for loop accesses out of bounds (line 10); it should iterate until `i < n`.
- Missing NULL check for the `malloc` function (line 15); it should be checked before usage.
- Potential memory leak due to missing `free(arr)` and `free(buffer)`; dynamically allocated memory should be released.
- The variable `unused` (line 23) is declared but never used.

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure proper array bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow by changing the loop condition (`i < n` instead of `i <= n`).
- Always check for NULL after calling `malloc` to handle memory allocation failures.
- Implement memory deallocation with `free()` to prevent memory leaks.
- Remove or utilize unnecessary variables to improve clarity and maintainability.

Overall, the primary code issues are found in the `codetest.c` where buffer overflows and memory management issues need to be addressed across multiple commits. The `README.md` is consistent and well-formatted but contains repeated content in multiple commits. No syntax or significant logic issues are noted, ensuring that the documentation is clear for the intended audience.
