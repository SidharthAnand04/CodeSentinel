### Code Review Report:

#### Commit: 6b8807de9958586552b75f94fc8d6ef6351cdb3d
**Syntax Issues:**
- Line 17: Off-by-one error in the `for` loop condition in the `printArray` function: Original code `i <= size` should be changed to `i < size` to avoid accessing an out-of-bounds memory.

**Styling Issues:**
- No significant style issues found, but a consistent naming convention for variables and functions (e.g., camelCase or snake_case) might be beneficial for readability.

**Errors and Potential Issues:**
- Line 23: Potential buffer overflow when assigning values to `arr` in the `main` function. The loop should iterate up to `n - 1` to avoid overwriting memory.
- Line 28: Missing NULL check after calling `malloc` in `copyString` buffer to prevent a memory leak.

**Recommendations:**
- Replace the off-by-one error with `i < size` in `printArray`.
- In the main function, fix the buffer overflow by changing `i <= n` to `i < n` in the `for` loop.
